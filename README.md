Modeling the Ophiuchus stream
=============================

This repository contains the code used to produce results and create figures for [Spending too much time at the Galactic bar: chaotic fanning of the Ophiuchus stream](http://arxiv.org/abs/TODO). The source for the paper itself can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/adrn/ophiuchus-paper).

Dependencies
------------

The conda or pip installable packages are found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/adrn/ophiuchus/blob/master/requirements.txt). The following packages are additional dependencies:

* [Gary](https://github.com/adrn/gary)
* [Biff](https://github.com/adrn/biff)

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is [located here](http://adrian.pw/ophiuchus). The documentation does not describe how to run the science code (that requires a compute cluster or a lot of patience), but does explain code that may be useful for future studies. For example, a class that uses the [Astropy coordinates](http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/coordinates/index.html) framework to transform into the Ophiuchus coordinates used in this work, and an easy way to load the [Gary potential objects](http://gary.adrian.pw/en/latest/potential/index.html) used in this work.
